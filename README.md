# AffectGrid
AffectGrid Library for Android

A pretty simple library that allows to gather user ratings on an Affect Grid.

The grid allows for highlighting the axes:

Hiding them completely:

And having more or less fine-grained feedback:

The ratings can be gathered as raw values or as normalized values. 

The origin of the grid, and therefore the selected values can be switched between being the upper righthand corner or the center of the grid.
